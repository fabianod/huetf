# huetf

This project aims to improve OzTF 1.45 for the Brazilian QWTF Community - yes, we still play QWTF in 2017.

As the creator of the mod don't have source code for the OzTF 1.45 version, we had to decompile from original qwprogs.dat file.

At the actual stage there is no improvement made to the code, we have only fully functional compilable code 100% compatible with OzTF with minor issues (like constant variable names and all the source being on a single .qc file) that apeared due to decompilation step.

For the next days probably we will gonna have many improvements mainly on clanmode, statistics, demo recording and parametrization on some features.

To compile this source you'll gonna need to use fteqcc or gmqcc.
